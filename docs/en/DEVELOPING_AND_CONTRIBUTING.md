# Developing and Contributing

This document contains instructions for:
- Setting up an environment locally for development
- Running test code

## Install and Setup Docker

1) Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)

2) Create a machine in preparation for next steps
```
docker-machine create default
```

## Fast/Iterative Local Development

Changing Go code, rebuilding and then restarting the entire Docker environment can waste a fair bit of time. To speed up iteration times, I just run only the PostgresSQL server 

1) Setup your current console windows environment to use the Docker Machine you created in the "Install and Setup Docker" step if you haven't already.
```
eval $(docker-machine env default)
```

If you get the following error and you're using Docker Toolbox, you may need to start up your virtual machine again.
```
Error checking TLS connection: Host is not running
```

2) Start the PostgresSQL server in detached mode (-d) and to just immediately show me the logs. I do things this way so that if you close the console window running, your SQL server will continue to run in the background.
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d db && docker-compose logs -f
```

3) Create a copy of the provided [config.example.json](/config.example.json) file and call it "config.json". You'll need to change the "database.host" name to your Docker machines IP, which you can retrieve by running the following command:
```
docker-machine ip
```

Whatever IP address you get back from that command, put it into your config.json file. It should look something like this:
```json
{
	"web": {
		"port": 8080
	},
	"database": {
		"host": "192.168.99.100",
		"port": 5432,
		"user": "admin",
		"password": "password"
	}
}
```

4) Build your application
```
go build
```

5) Run your application
```
./contact-site
```

## Destroying / Clearing the database

For iteration purposes, this application includes a flag that drops all the tables for you. This allows you to clear your database so you can iterate and make changes to the setup logic within the codebase.

1) One method is to use the applications destroy flag, this will drop the tables it created.
```
./contact-site --destroy
```

2) Another method is to just destroy the Docker containers completely. If you've changed the POSTGRES_USER/POSTGRES_PASSWORD fields, you may want to do this. 
```
docker-compose stop &&
docker-compose rm
```

## Run Tests

These are instructions for running various tests in the project. 

* Run all tests (requires that PostgresSQL is running)
```
go test ./...
```

* Run unit tests
```
go test ./internal/...
```

* Run integration tests (requires that PostgresSQL is running)
```
go test ./test
```

## Run Tests With Code Coverage

The following commands run tests and also give information relating to code coverage. When I last observed

1) Generate code coverage for integration tests
```
go test ./test -cover -coverpkg=./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
```

2) Open coverage file in the browser
```
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```
